# paper-tooltip

`<paper-tooltip>` is a Material Design label that appears when the user hovers
over an element with the cursor, or focuses the element with the keyboard.

If the target is focusable, the focus and blur event are preferred over the mouse-events.
So if the cursor is still in an input field, the tooltip stays althought the mouse was moved elsewhere.
